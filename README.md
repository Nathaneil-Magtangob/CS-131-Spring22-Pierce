# CS-131-Spring22-Pierce

For this project, you will create a folder and use your full name as your folder's name. 
Corresponding file structure:
```
.
|--🗀 Student 1 Full Name(sample)
|--🗀 Student 2 Full Name(sample)
|-- README.md
```

Then, to keep everything organized, you will create subfolders in your main folder to group the type of files you will submit.
_Note: You can name your subfolder anything you want as long as it is appropriate and relevant to your project. Notice how student 1 has a different subfolder names as student 2_
```
.
|--🗀 Student 1 Full Name(sample)
    |--🗁 Programs
    |--🗁 Powerpoints
    |--🗁 External Link(s)
|--🗀 Student 2 Full Name(sample)
    |--🗁 Programs
    |--🗁 Powerpoints
    |--🗁 Videos
|-- README.md
```

Lastly, you need to add the files in your subfolders according to their appropriate type.
_If you will submit a youtube video for the project, create a README.md file then paste the link there_
